## Overall Learning 

This internship provided comprehensive hands-on exposure to industrial automation by strengthening skills in microcontroller-based control systems, servo motor interfacing, temperature regulation, sensor integration, and real-time feedback mechanisms. Practical experience in motion planning, kinematics, and system reliability enhanced the understanding of precision automation and fault-tolerant design. The project also reinforced the importance of modular, maintainable system architectures aligned with industrial standards. In addition to technical growth, the internship improved professional competencies such as industrial documentation, structured problem-solving, time management, and milestone-based project execution, effectively bridging theoretical knowledge with real-world automation engineering practices.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Autonomous Micro Soldering Robotic Arm </h3>
<p>
  The project leverages real-time control and vision-assisted alignment to enhance soldering accuracy, operational efficiency, and repeatability in micro-electronics assembly tasks. The ESP32 provides reliable processing and control, while the VC02 camera supports visual feedback for precise targeting, and the MG995 servos ensure stable, smooth, and responsive arm motion. The system is designed for industrial and laboratory environments where precision, consistency, and automation are critical. Performance evaluation demonstrates stable operation, smooth motion control, accurate solder placement, and efficient task execution, validating the system’s suitability for automated micro-soldering applications in modern industrial settings.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
The last communication and professional attitude session was conducted effectively and was highly informative. The mentors, especially Mr. Pramod Sir, explained every concept clearly and patiently, making the session easy to understand and engaging. The ice-breaking activities were interactive and helped create a positive learning environment. The final session also went very well, providing valuable insights into social awareness and health-related issues, including problem identification and practical understanding. Overall, the sessions were well-organized, educational, and beneficial, contributing positively to both personal and professional development.

## **Community Services**

<!-- add descreption in your own words -->

I thoroughly enjoyed the community service activities and found them very meaningful. As part of the service, I planted four trees, including mango, gooseberry, and jackfruit, contributing to environmental sustainability. In addition, I participated in a government initiative to distribute health kits to elderly people in our locality under the Kudumbashree initiative of the Government of Kerala. These activities helped me develop social responsibility, environmental awareness, and a deeper understanding of community welfare programs.<!-- add descreption in your own words -->

### **Activities Involved**
The assigned activity was not carried out due to health-related issues and was subsequently replaced with other approved community service activities.
- **Blood Donation** – Donated blood and supported basic assistance tasks during the camp.
  
 Calicut, Keralam
- **Tree Plantation Drive** – Participated by planting trees and contributing to environmental improvement.

  Calicut, Keralam
- **Helping Elder Citizens** – Assisted two elderly individuals with simple daily tasks and provided support where needed.
